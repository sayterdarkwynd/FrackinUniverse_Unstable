    "After twenty assorted tests on the genome markers for this curative agent, we were unable to determine what caused C7 to go ballistic and attack, kill, mutilate and devour the other rats at random. The viral load in his cells is not present, nor is there any trace of change in his physiology.",
    "While it took weeks, we have isolated the problem. Some sort of rapidly mutating particle, so small as to be undetectable even in the electron microscope, has tainted the main sample. The source of this particle remains largely unknown, though my theory that Greg mixed some of that fluid into his batch seems the most likely cause.",
    "I got Greg to admit it: He put that weird fluid in his mix. According to him, testing showed that the effect it has on biological samples is astounding and was worth a test if it meant the safety of our species. He seems a bit overly defensive , despite my assurances that he was not in any form of administrative trouble.",
    "Greg started acting a bit off today. I can't quite put my finger on it. Something is up with his speech patterns. It's slight, but there. I'll keep an eye on him. In the meantime I have managed to isolate the strange particle and neutralize it in subject C7. Two hours ago I administered antibodies into her, and now I wait to see what happens.",
    "Subject C7 , when injected with antibodies: At first subject seemed fine. At four-hours, thirty seven seconds after injection the subject began to writhe in agony. After 14 minutes, subject appeared to suffer complete and total brain-death, though other biological functions remain operational."
