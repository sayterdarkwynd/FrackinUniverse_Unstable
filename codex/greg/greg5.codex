    "No sign of Greg for a few days now. We can hear him tinkering in his office, but any time we knock he refuses to answer or even acknowledge us. Reason unknown. Probably just hyper-focused.",
    "Subject C7 has...resurrected. Brain functions in the rat have resumed ordinary function. However, subject appears to have forgotten how to be a rat and is busy screeching at other rats in the room. Prion count is absurdly high. We won't merge him with the population this time as I have no desire to clean rat viscera off of every surface in the lab again.",
    "I can't explain it, but somehow other subjects in the lab are now infected with whatever caused issues to C7. They exhibit the same symptomology, despite being in a clean-room with a dedicated air supply, glass walls and no direct contact to the subject. I checked the tapes from the night: no one entered or tampered with the experiments.",
    "Every single rat has been 'changed' by C7. The upside is that all traces of the hostile virus have been removed from the host. Our prion works! Without some means to remove the negative effects, however, we will not be able to use it. I doubt everyone wants to lose who they were just to remove a sickness.",
    "After closer inspection, it seems that any and all stimulus experienced by C7 are also at least partially experienced by other subjects in the lab. When presented with a small amount of narcotic, C7 was rendered intoxicated. C6 through C24 all simultaneously shared the same precise physical actions for a period of 72 minutes.",
    "Greg finally came out of his room after 2 full weeks. He is...different. He keeps repeating his name, over and over again. Nothing more. He becomes increasingly agitated trying to communicate with us. He clearly *thinks* he is talking fine. Yet all that comes out is 'Greg'. I've recommended he stay contained due to how the rats reacted to C7.",
    "Somehow our air system was compromised last night. Air from outside has found its way within the complex. We are all infected with the virus, and are living on borrowed time. The rest of the team agrees that we need to speed up research on Gregs cure.",
    "Two days later, and not a one of us is any more ill. At least half of us should be dead by now, given the track record that the Shaxxral virus has. Something has impeded the capacity it has to affect our cells. Greg still can't communicate with us, but I would wager his cure has something to do with it.",
    "Whatever that fluid did to this agent, I am recommending the desctruction of all remainiing samples. Both agent and fluid sample. These are too dangerous to be allowed to survive for further research. I am commencing tests on blood samples obtained from fellow staff members, as we have grown concerned that somehow Gregs experimental prion is spreading.",
    "I don't understand what is happening! Somehow our *other* facilities in entirely different sections of the galaxy are also experiencing the exact same issues. The prion...or whatever it is...is somehow spreading to populations across the vast gulf of space! How this is even possible is utterly beyond my capacity to theorize on.",
    "I've begun to hate. Not people here in the lab. Just...the uninfected. Specifically, I have unavoidable visions of brutally murdering them however I possibly can. It's not unlike having a 'wet dream', and when I awake I feel aroused. The others also remark on having the exact same....dreams? Visiosn? Either way, we're terrified.",
    "Someone opened the main doors last night. It's out, free, and able to spread. The plus side is that the virus eradicating our people will be cured. Unfortunately, I can make no assurances on long-term implications of what this cure will do to us as a species.",
    "My....mind. Slips. Seeing things I shouldn't. Greg. Hard to formulate thoughts in language. Gregga. Name easier. Feel connected to source virus, like hive mind. Greg. Be Greg."
